# Reschedule Reason System

## Overview

The reschedule reason system allows administrators to track and categorize why appointments are being rescheduled. This is particularly useful for understanding patterns in schedule changes and improving appointment management.

## Features

### 1. Reschedule Reason Field

- Added `rescheduleReason` field to the `Appointment` model
- Stores the reason for rescheduling appointments

### 2. Schedule Change Type Combobox

- Predefined categories for common schedule change reasons:
  - **Cambio de horario escolar** - School schedule changes
  - **Cambio de actividad extracurricular** - Extracurricular activity changes
  - **Cambio de horario de trabajo de los padres** - Parent work schedule changes
  - **Cambio de disponibilidad de transporte** - Transportation availability changes
  - **Otro compromiso familiar** - Other family commitments
  - **Otro motivo** - Other reasons

### 3. Automatic Reason Generation

- When a schedule change type is selected, the system automatically generates a formatted reason
- Format: "Cambio de horario regular: [selected_type]"
- Custom additional notes can be added for more details

### 4. UI Integration
